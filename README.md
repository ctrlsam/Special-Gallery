# What is this?
A simple Wordpress plugin that adds a 'special gallery'.

# How do I use it?
Install and activate the plugin in Wordpress. Afterwards, there will be a new menu option called 'Special Gallery'.

By clicking on this menu item, you will be brought to the plugin dashboard. Once you're done customising, simply insert this shortcode into any page you want the gallery to appear.
