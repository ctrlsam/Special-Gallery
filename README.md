# What is this?
A simple Wordpress plugin that adds a 'special gallery'.

# How do I use it?

- Drag the folder into the `wp-plugins` directory.
- Create a `data` folder in the `special-gallery` folder.
- (Optional) Create an `items.json` file in `data` that contains `[]`
- Activate the plugin through Wordpress.

Afterwards, there will be a new menu option called 'Special Gallery'.
You may need to click on 'Dashboard' to see it.

By clicking on this menu item, you will be brought to the plugin control panel. When you're ready to use the gallery, insert the below shortcode into any page you want the gallery to appear.
