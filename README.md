# What is this?
A simple gallery plugin for Wordpress. It enables you to manage multiple galleries and insert them into your website. Each gallery contains an array of items, that display in a grid, but expand into a unique slideshow when clicked.


# How do I setup the plugin?
- Clone the source from Github.
- Drag the plugin folder into `wp-plugins`.
- Create a `data` folder in `special-gallery`.
- Then, create a `galleries.json` file in `data` that contains `[]`.
- Activate the plugin through Wordpress.

After you have activated the plugin, click on 'Dashboard'. There will be a new menu option called 'Special Gallery'.

<strong>Note:</strong> Don't embed multiple galleries on the same page. This will mess up the JavaScript causing the galleries to not show properly.
